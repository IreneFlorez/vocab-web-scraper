# vocab-web-scraper
Page spider in python with PyCharm

Created a web scraping tool to extract data (word list) from websites using beautifulsoup4, argparse, urllib.request and pytests. 
Data is downloaded into an indexed sqlite3 list using frequency count and length. 

See part II of the scraper: https://github.com/IreneFlorez/vocab-tool
